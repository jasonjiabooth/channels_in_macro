Finally, in line with previous literature, I estimate the covariance between MPCs and incomes to be negative in the data.

My paper makes two contributions to this literature. First, I introduce a decomposition of the monetary policy transmission mechanism into its various sources of effects on consumption that is useful to shed light on the under-lying mechanisms in any such model (see Kaplan, Moll, and Violante 2018 for an influential application). Second, I argue that sufficient statistics can discipline the construction of these models. By making sure that the model’s sufficient statistics match the data, researchers can ensure that, even if the model is misspecified, its predictions for the response of consumption to shocks are consistent with the empir-ical evidence.

(2017), the earnings heterogeneity channel also amplifies the effects of monetary policy. Future work can build on these empirical results in two ways: by providing more precise measures of exposures across groups of agents or regions to inform the debate on the winners and losers from changes in monetary policy, and by estimat-ing the sufficient statistics more precisely in administrative data to help quantify the aggregate effect of this redistribution.4 A rapidly growing literature analyzes the effects of monetary policy in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models with rich heterogeneity, matching vari-ous aspects of the cross section such as the wealth distribution. Prominent exam-ples include Gornemann, Kuester, and Nakajima (2016); McKay, Nakamura, and Steinsson (2016); and Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2018). These structural mod-els overcome a number of important limitations of my sufficient statistics approach. They can study the role of investment, analyze the precise interaction between mon-etary and fiscal policy, and explore the effect of shocks that are persistent and/or announced in advance. My paper makes two contributions to this literature. First, I introduce a decomposition of the monetary policy transmission mechanism into its various sources of effects on consumption that is useful to shed light on the under-lying mechanisms in any such model (see Kaplan, Moll, and Violante 2018 for an influential application). Second, I argue that sufficient statistics can discipline the construction of these models. By making sure that the model’s sufficient statistics match the data, researchers can ensure that, even if the model is misspecified, its predictions for the response of consumption to shocks are consistent with the empir-ical evidence. This paper is motivated by an extensive empirical literature documenting that MPCs are large and heterogeneous in the population (see Jappelli and Pistaferri 2010\", True)"

A recent literature has demonstrated that, under certain conditions, production networks can lead firm-or sector-specific shocks to generate aggregate fluctua-tions, e.g., Horvath (2000), Carvalho (2010), Acemoglu et al. (2012), Carvalho and Gabaix (2013), Baqaee and Fahri (2019), and Carvalho and Grassi (2019). Shocks to a single sector or firm propagate to other sectors or firms through the trade of intermediate inputs. Foerster, Sartre, and Watson (2011) and Atalay (2017) quan-tify these channels, and their results suggest that sector-specific shocks can explain a substantial portion of observed aggregate output fluctuations. However, trade in intermediate inputs by itself does not induce enough correlation in production across sectors to account for all of the observed volatility of aggregate output. We show that news media can serve as a powerful additional source of sectoral comovement. A basic premise of our argument is that individual firms do not have the resources to directly observe every sector in the production network. Instead, firms rely on news media to monitor the economy on their behalf and to report the most newsworthy developments. However, even accurate reports provide only a partial picture of the economy. Such partial information, in turn, may lead firms to over-or underestimate how much of their product other firms will demand. As in Angeletos and La’O (2010, 2013), a firm that is overly optimistic about demand for its output hires too much labor. If firms across different sectors receive the same partial information via news media, over-or u nder-hiring of labor will be correlated across sectors. News media thus function as a coordination device for the economy, increasing the correlation of sectoral outputs beyond what would result from sec-tors’ trading relationships alone. We embed state-dependent news reporting in a modified version of the multisector model of Acemoglu et al. (2012). In our model, news media act as information inter-mediaries that relay information about the state of the economy to firms. We argue that there are two aspects of this role that are particularly relevant for understanding business cycles. First, news organizations monitor the economy by collecting and producing information about a large number of events. Second, they make editorial decisions about which events are sufficiently newsworthy to be reported.1 We for-malize these editorial decisions using news selection functions, first introduced in Nimark and Pitschner (2019). A news selection function is a mapping from the state of the world to a vector of reported outcomes. News selection functions provide a flexible way to model state-dependent editorial decisions, thereby capturing the changing focus of news coverage over time. By determining what gets reported in which states of the world, a news selec-tion function implicitly defines a notion of newsworthiness.
